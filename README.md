It's a list of mobile apps.


## Installation

We use [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/):

    npm install grunt-cli -g
    npm install


## Development

Load from a page with an origin (i.e., a server). If you're running locally,
use grunt to fire up a local server:

    DEBUG=1 OPEN=1 grunt connect

And to automatically recompile templates upon file changes:

    grunt watch
